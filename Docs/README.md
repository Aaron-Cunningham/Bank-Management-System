Banking application
=
This is a terminal based banking application that uses the Pandas Data Analysis Library. 
This app has a vast amount of functionality such as been able to see all clients of 
the bank, deposit/withdraw money from a clients account, search for specific clients
in the bank, and add a client to the bank. This was created as part of my ***Programming 
portfolio 2*** assessment at Newcastle University. This projected used an OOP approach by 
creating objects such as 'menu' and 'functions' in order to call functions and run functions
from other classes




`pip install pandas`
